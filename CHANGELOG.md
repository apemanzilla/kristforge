# Changelog

## 3.1.6

- Fix panic with intel iGPU OpenCL runtime due to flaky kernel argument type checks (https://github.com/tmpim/kristforge/issues/18)
- Updated dependencies

## 3.1.5

- Fix mined krist being double-counted (https://github.com/tmpim/kristforge/issues/16)
- Updated dependencies

## 3.1.4

- Fix crash on systems where OpenCL isn't available (will now degrade gracefully to CPU-only mining as intended)

## 3.1.3 

- Allow specifying krist address via `KRISTFORGE_ADDRESS` environment variable
- Fix crash related to OpenCL compiler unloading

## 3.1.2

- Revert Intel default thread count change from version 3.1.1
- Set CPU mining threads to lower priority to avoid crippling system performance

## 3.1.1

- On Intel systems, uses fewer threads by default to avoid crippling system performance
- Improved UI a bit

## 3.1.0

- Added CPU support including two mining kernels:
    - `unoptimized` which makes no assumptions about instruction sets and should work everywhere
    - `SHA` which takes advantage of the SHA instruction set on recent processors to offer dramatically better speeds
- Updated dependencies

## 3.0.0-alpha

- Initial release with only GPU support via OpenCL
